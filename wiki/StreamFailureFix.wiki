#summary The streams fail in Chrome version 7+, here is how to fix it.

= Fix what? =

The most recent version of Google Chrome broke the streaming support in Jamendo Radio.

You need to start Chrome with the command line switch "--disable-byte-range-support" for it to work again.

= Short guide for windows users =

1. Create a shortcut to the chrome.exe file on the desktop (or somewhere else, if you prefer).

2. Open the properties for the newly created shortcut.

3. In the field "Target", to "--disable-byte-range-support" to the end, and be sure to separate it with a space.

4. Launch chrome using that shortcut. Jamendo Radio will now be able to stream as before.


For reference, the target-field of my shortcut looks like this: "C:\Users\Fredrik\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --disable-byte-range-support"
