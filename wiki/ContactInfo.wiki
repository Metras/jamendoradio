I'm no designer. Something that should be painstakingly obvious to anyone visiting the options page of this extension. So I need some help here, to get a proper page design, some colors (preferably orange, with purple highlights, so it follows Jamendo's color scheme).

The popup could also use some design work. I would like larger control buttons, and maybe build in jquery and make some nifty animations.

I'm very open to suggestions here, and if I get a lot of response, I could even build support for skins...
